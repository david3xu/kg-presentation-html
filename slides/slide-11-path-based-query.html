<h2>Path-Based Query - Power of Traversal</h2>

<p><strong>Finding connections between entities</strong>:</p>

<p>SPARQL (variable path length):</p>
<pre><code>SELECT ?person1 ?person2 ?path
WHERE {
  ?person1 kg:name "Albert Einstein" .
  ?person2 kg:name "Stephen Hawking" .
  ?person1 (kg:influenced)+ ?person2 .
}
</code></pre>

<p>Cypher (showing the actual path):</p>
<pre><code>MATCH path = (p1:Person {name: "Albert Einstein"})-[:INFLUENCED*]-&gt;(p2:Person {name: "Stephen Hawking"})
RETURN [node in nodes(path) | node.name] as connectionPath
</code></pre>

<p>Path queries reveal connections that would be extremely difficult to express in traditional query languages, especially with variable-length paths.</p>
