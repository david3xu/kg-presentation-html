<h2>Key Benefits - Practical Impact</h2>
<p><strong>Tangible benefits of knowledge graph implementation</strong>:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Enhanced discovery</strong>: Find connections impossible in traditional systems
        <ul>
            <li>Example: Identifying indirect competitive threats through supply chain analysis</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Reduced integration costs</strong>: 40-60% lower than traditional approaches
        <ul>
            <li>Example: Finance firm reduced integrations from 1200+ point-to-point to centralized model</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Accelerated time-to-insight</strong>: 70-80% faster complex questions
        <ul>
            <li>Example: Pharmaceutical research reducing candidate identification from weeks to hours</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Future-proof architecture</strong>: Adaptable to changing requirements
        <ul>
            <li>Example: Healthcare system smoothly incorporating new data types without disruption</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
